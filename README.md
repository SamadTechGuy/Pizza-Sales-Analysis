# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
This is a sales analysis of Plato's Pizza restaurant transactional data, New Jersey.
# Brief Introduction
Plato's restaurant is into the sales of different pizza types and sizes. The restaurant have been collecting transactional data for a year now and haven't been able to put it to good use. So, recently, the Manager, Mario Maven hired me as a BI Consultant to help them analyze the data and put together a report to help find opportunities to drive more sales and work efficiently. 
## Brief Overview of the dataset
Data was provided by Maven Analytics Team and is a public dataset made available through Enrique Ruiz. The dataset is structured and contains 4 tables in CSV format - Orders, Order Details, Pizzas, and Pizza Types. Each table has at least 3 columns which consist of: Order Id, date, time, Order details id, pizza id, quantity, pizza type id, size, price, name, category, and ingredients. The data contained about 49,000 rows.
